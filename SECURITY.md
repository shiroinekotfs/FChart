## What is "Long-Term Charts on Service" (LTCoS)?

> Long-Term Charts on Service is a definition of a chart that can be used for a very long time, but not last longer than 3 months.
>
> That doesn't mean it's the release day of the chart, but the release day of AIRAC that the chart relies on. [See AIRAC expiration on Jeppesen](https://ww2.jeppesen.com/update-cycle-and-effective-dates-schedule/). On the top of the web page, you'll see if the navigation data on your chart is LTCoS or not. 

Normally, regular charts can only last within 28 days since those have been released. However, to minimize the maintenance and maximize the capability of FChart, we will support regular charts and LTCoS side-by-side.

LTCoS can last up to 3 months. That means, even if the website hasn't been updated for 28 days and up to 3 months, the charts are still valid and you can still use them.

## Supported Versions (Jeppesen Charts and Navigation Data)

Normally, Jeppesen Charts are updated every 28 days. [See AIRAC expiration on Jeppesen](https://ww2.jeppesen.com/update-cycle-and-effective-dates-schedule/)

However, because each update has minimal changes, LTSoC will be provided on our end.
